                  Wheat is a crucial crop for global food security. Predicting its yield accurately helps with better planning and resource allocation. 
                  Our system uses Random Forest to predict regions with high, low, or very low wheat productivity based on environmental and geographical factors.

                  The foundation of the system is high-quality data from reliable sources such as government agricultural departments or open datasets.
                  Data includes:
                  - Historical wheat production data (10+ years).
                  - Environmental data: Rainfall, temperature, soil pH, etc.
                  - Geographical data: Latitude, longitude, elevation.
                  The collected data was cleaned, filtered, and organized to remove inconsistencies and missing values.

                  By analyzing the dataset, we identified the most influential features for prediction:
                  - Rainfall in the growing season (mm).
                  - Average temperature during critical growth stages (Â°C).
                  - Soil quality indicators (pH, organic matter content).
                  - Proximity to water sources and elevation.
                  These features were engineered to enhance the model's prediction capabilities.

                  The Random Forest algorithm was chosen due to its robustness and ability to handle complex data relationships. Key benefits include:
                  - Handling non-linear relationships in data.
                  - Reducing overfitting compared to individual decision trees.
                  - Providing feature importance for better interpretability.

                  The model was trained on 80% of the data, while the remaining 20% was used for validation. Steps included:
                  - Splitting data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
                  - Scaling features to ensure uniformity.
                  - Hyperparameter tuning: Adjusting tree depth, number of trees, and minimum samples per leaf for optimal performance.
                  Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall validated the model's effectiveness.

                    - **UI Design**: 
                      Creating intuitive and visually appealing interfaces with wireframes and prototypes.
                    - **Frontend Integration**:
                      Developing a dynamic, responsive web application using modern frameworks like React.js.
