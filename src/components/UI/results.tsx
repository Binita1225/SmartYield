Start by testing your soil to identify any nutrient deficiencies and enhance its fertility by adding organic matter or compost. Ensure proper soil aeration through timely tilling. Optimize your water management by providing consistent and moderate moisture, avoiding over- or under-irrigation, and considering efficient systems like drip or sprinkler irrigation. Choosing high-quality, drought-resistant, or disease-resistant wheat varieties suitable for your region can also make a significant difference. Additionally, apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations and ensure seeds are treated before planting to prevent pests and diseases. By addressing these key factors, you can work towards achieving better wheat yields."

Opt for high-quality seeds that are drought-resistant or well-suited to your local climate, and treat them before planting to safeguard against pests and diseases. Additionally, use balanced fertilizers based on soil test results to ensure proper nutrient availability. Regular monitoring of crop health and timely pest control measures are also essential.
